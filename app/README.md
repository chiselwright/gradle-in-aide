# Using gradle with AIDE

## Setup

Other than checking out this project the only required action should be to set the path to the local repository.
You can use the one included in this repo.

* Menu
* → Settings
* → Build & Run
* → Local Maven repositories
* add the full path to "local-maven" on your device

    # e.g.
    /sdcard/Git/gradle-in-aide/this-can-live-outside-the-project/local-maven

* Refresh Maven repository

Everything should be funky.
